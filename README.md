Place the `OnboardFlow` component anywhere in your app. It will automatically take up the entire screen. To change the 
default behavior, see the [docs on supported props](https://docs.frigade.com/docs/components/highlevel).

```jsx
import { OnboardFlow } from 'react-native-onboard';

const App = () => {
  
  return (
    <OnboardFlow
      pages={[
        {
          title: 'Welcome to my app',
          subtitle: 'This is page 1',
          imageUri: 'https://frigade.com/img/example1.png',
        },
        {
          title: 'Page 2 header',
          subtitle: 'This is page 2',
          imageUri: 'https://frigade.com/img/example2.png',
        }
      ]}
    />
  );
};
```

## Docs
The official docs are available at [docs.frigade.com](https://docs.frigade.com/).

## Customization

implementing a series of provided interfaces. See the [Official Docs](https://docs.frigade.com/docs/intro) to learn more.

## Updating your onboarding flow without app builds and releases
While the above examples contain hard-coded strings and images for illustrative purposes, we highly recommend loading your strings and presentation
layer logic from your API rather than as plain strings in your app.

[Frigade API](https://frigade.com/) offers a hosted service that allows you to update your onboarding flow without having to push a new app build to the app store while also providing a series of very useful [integrations](https://frigade.com/).
